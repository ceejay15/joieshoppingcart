Description: This is basic shopping cart only and focusing on front-end and UI/UX design, for demo purposes only. Back-end will follow on Phase Two including
dynamic data, in-stock and out-of-stock feature.

What this product is not: Fully functional front-end, back-end and UI/UX shopping E-Commerce app/shopping cart. Bug may still persists. It is under developement
and this is just an initial upload. This READ ME file may change from time to time.

Anyone can critic and have their own better way of giving a solution to every situation. I am not a hard-core coder, know-it-all genius. There is a big big room for improvement
and, one way is to start learning and practicing. Code may also change from time to time until it's final completion.

How to:
1. Install Node if you don't have any Node installed
2. Install Angular CLI to your desired folder
3. Run 'npm install' to install necessary package included on package.json
4. Run 'ng serve --o' to run and open the application to your browser
